			The <i>prisoner's dilemma</i> is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals
			might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin
			Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma",
			presenting it as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
			Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other.
			The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge.
			Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying
			that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison.</li>
			<li>If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison.</li>
			<li>If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free.</li>
			<li>If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).</li>
		</ul>
